(Optional) Early abstract: No later than about 90 days (exact date to be deter
mined) after the final version of this call is published, a short document (with no
more than three pages) can be submitted with a title, a list of team members, and
a preliminary abstract of a planned full package to be submitted later (Ph3). The
abstract should identify the primitives to be thresholdized and their corresponding
category and subcategory(ies)/type(s), give an outline of the threshold approach
(including system model, the protocol approach, and main security properties), and
list the most relevant bibliographic references. This phase for optional submission
(not mandatory and non-committing) is intended to facilitate early discussion of the
expected coverage of each category/subcategory, and may help determine useful
merges, differentiations, or alternative submissions
