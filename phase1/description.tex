\section{Phase One: Abstract}

No later than 90 days after the final version of the call is published, a short
document (no more than three pages) can be submitted with:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A title
  \item A list of team members
  \item A preliminary abstract of a planned full phase three package.
\end{enumerate}

The abstract should identify the primitives to be thresholdized and their
corresponding category and types, gives an outline of the threshold approach
and relevant bibliography references.
