\section{Description of Submission}

\subsection{Primitive to be Thresholdized}

In this work,
we describe FROST,
a two-round threshold signature scheme that thresholdizes the EdDSA signature scheme.
In particular,
we will provide a Cat1 submission for subcategory C1.1 EdDSA signing.

\subsection{Outline of Approach}

FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)~\cite{KomloG20,BellareCKMTZ22} addresses the need for efficient threshold EdDSA signing operations while improving upon the state of the art to ensure strong security properties \emph{without} limiting the parallelism of signing operations.
FROST achieves improved efficiency in the optimistic case that no participant misbehaves.
However, in the case where a misbehaving participant contributes malformed values during the protocol,
honest parties can identify and exclude the misbehaving participant, and re-run the protocol.

Here, we describe the (unoptimized) two-round version of the FROST.
However, implementations may wish to perform the first round in a batched setting,
allowing the scheme to be used in a manner where online signing requires only a single round of communication.
